Assignment 2 - Haukai

**Part 1: Standards, protocols and security issues**

Website: https://amys-op.github.io/Haukai/

*Question 1a*
All code is valid. Screenshots of pages and html validation are in the folder labelled 1a

*Question 1c*
This site is acessible, all images have alt text to enable those using screen readers to be able to "see" what is in the image. The site is well structured using universally accepted structure with navigation and footer clearly seperated from the body of the page and no tables being used for layout. Colours have been choosen for good contrast as per the aim accessibility checker for colour contrast. 

*Question 1d*
Privacy statement is at https://amys-op.github.io/Haukai/privacy.html

*Question 1e*
Http caching is where a browsers stores local copies of resources so that it can serve up web pages faster. This gives for a better expereience for a viewer, and also decreases the load on the internet connection/web server. It can play havoc with some websites where the content has changed, but the browser doesn't go back to the server to get the upated content.

Content Delivery Networks (CDN) are groups of servers, located in different regions that host assets for a site so that traffic has less distance to travel which will increase loading times for websites.

Security issues are an important factor in any website - especially any that interface with other applications such as Haukai's reservation system. There needs to be the ability to block extensions and harmful code being entered into the online booking form which could cause the reservation system to fail. It is also important to ensure valid certificates are generated for the site to give customers confidence in entering their personal information into the booking form - the site needs to have https. Being aware of other attacks such as DDOS and having processes in place to help mitigate the damage from these is also a good idea - CDNs can help with this by distributing where the load is going for the website.

**Part 2: Tools and techniques**

*Question 2a*
Screenshots included in folder showing git hub being used for source control and structure.

*Question 2b*
This site has been made mobile friendly, and passes Google's automated testing, a screenshot of this has been included in the submission. 

The viewport has been configured to allow browsers to adjust the pages dimension and scaling to suit the device. I've used one of the w3 schools resposive style sheets to link to which helps to move the right hand pane to the bottom on browsers with less width. 

*Question 2c*
Trailing spaces installed and screenshot included in folder submitted.

*Question 2d*
Page load times have been optimised for speed and load in less than 2 seconds as shown in the screenshot in the folder submitted.
